# Write a python function called fizzbizz which will take a number n as input 
# and print numbers i from 1 to n.
# If i is divisible by 3, it will print fizz instead of i
# If i is divisible by 5, it will print bizz instead of i
# If i is divisible by 15, it will print fizzbizz instead i
# Otherwise, it will just print i
